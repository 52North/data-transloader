# Source Mappings

Different data providers have different terms for the same observed properties, the same units of measurement, or the same unit symbols. These have to be converted in the Data Transloader to a standard set.

This is handled by a mapping Class, which uses the source data in `lib/mappings` for definitions. Please see [lib/mappings/README.markdown](../lib/mappings/README.markdown) for more information.

# Source Mappings

Different data providers have different terms for the same observed properties, the same units of measurement, or the same unit symbols. These have to be converted in the Data Transloader to a standard set.

## Campbell Scientific

Some properties are sourced from the appendix of [hardware manuals](https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/af/manuals/cpec200.pdf).

Mapping files are stored in [../lib/mappings/campbell_scientific](../lib/mappings/campbell_scientific).

## Data Garrison

Mapping files are stored in [../lib/mappings/data_garrison](../lib/mappings/data_garrison).

## Environment Canada

Properties and units sourced from [PDF](http://dd.weather.gc.ca/observations/doc/SWOB-ML_Product_User_Guide_v8.2_e.pdf). A complete list of properties has not been converted, as there are many duplicates across different sub-providers.

Mapping files are stored in [../lib/mappings/environment_canada](../lib/mappings/environment_canada).

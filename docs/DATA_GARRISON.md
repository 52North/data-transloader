# Loading Data from Data Garrison

The following instructions are for setting up station data and uploading observations to SensorThings API with data from [Data Garrison][DG].

[DG]: https://datagarrison.com

### Step 1: Downloading Sensor Metadata

To conform to the OGC SensorThings API entity model, the `Thing`, `Location`, `Sensors`, `Observed Properties`, and `Datastreams` must be initialized using the weather station details before sensor data observations can be uploaded. The metadata can be downloaded using a command:

```
$ transload get metadata --source data_garrison --user 300234063581640 --station 300234065673960 --cache /datastore/weather
```

This will download the sensor metadata from the Data Garrison source for the user with ID `300234063581640` and station with the identifier `300234065673960`, and store the metadata in a JSON file in the `/datastore/weather` directory.

The directory `/datastore/weather/data_garrison/metadata` will be created if it does not already exist.

A file will be created at `/datastore/weather/data_garrison/metadata/300234063581640/300234065673960.json`; if it already exists, it will be **overwritten**. Setting up automated backups of this directory is recommended.

Inside the `300234065673960.json` file the sensor metadata will be stored. Editing these values will affect the metadata that is stored in SensorThings API in the metadata upload step. This file also will store the URLs to the SensorThings API entities, which is used by a later step to upload Observations without first having to crawl the SensorThings API instance.

## Data Model Mapping

Here is how the metadata and data from Data Garrison is mapped to SensorThings API entities.

* Transceiver Details (to `Thing` properties)
    * ID
    * Transmission Interval
    * Network
    * Board Revision
* Logger (to `Thing` properties)
    * Serial Number
    * Logging Interval
    * Sampling Interval
    * Part Number

The above items will be stored as metadata under the `properties` attribute for the `Thing` entity. Other metadata from Data Garrison is excluded as it would require constant updates as the data values change, and the `Thing` metadata is not continuously updated in this transloader application.

* Sensors (to Sensor, Datastream, Observed Property, Unit of Measurement)
    * e.g. "Pressure" (to Observed Property)
        * Units (to UoM)

Additional metadata *could* be stored in the `Sensor` entity under  the `metadata` attribute, but that attribute is limited to `pdf` and `SensorML` currently (this is a limitation in GOST). Instead, a link to the station metadata page will be used as the `metadata` value.

I noticed that in some Data Garrison stations, the metadata for some of the sensors was incorrect. This must then be manually corrected by editing the metadata cache file after the "get metadata" step.

There is also no latitude/longitude or location information. This must be manually added to the metadata cache file as well.

### SensorThings API Entities

* Thing
    * Name (from station ID, or customized in cached file)
    * Description (longer form of Name)
    * Properties (JSON object with Transceiver/Logger details)
* Location
    * Name (from station ID, or customized in cached file)
    * Description (longer form of Name)
    * encodingType (GeoJSON)
    * location (GeoJSON, must be added in cached file)
* Datastream
    * Name (from station ID and observed property)
    * Description (longer form of Name)
    * unitOfMeasurement (from Units, will probably need lookup table)
    * observationType (OM_Observation)
    * observedArea (Not used)
    * phenomenonTime (Not used)
    * resultTime (Not used)
* Sensor
    * Name (from station ID and observed property)
    * Description (longer form of Name)
    * encodingType (application/pdf due to limitation)
    * metadata (link to metadata page)
* Observed Property
    * Name (from metadata)
    * Description (longer form of Name)
    * Definition (link to example.org for now, later can link to dictionary site)
* Observation
    * phenomenonTime (from "Latest Conditions" time, timezone must be manually added to metadata cached file)
    * result (from latest value in sidebar)
    * resultTime (Not used)
    * resultQuality (Not used)
    * valudTime (Not used)
    * parameters (Not used)
* FeatureOfInterest
    * Entity is omitted; will be generated by server from Location entity

* Rename `new_station` to `get_station` for Provider classes
* Add shared StationMethods module for sharing code between Station classes
* Add overwrite option for metadata (defaults to `false` or "off")
* Add schema versioning for stores to make future upgrades cleaner
* Fix bug where HTTP class would inherit request options from previous requests
* Fix wrong string for warning message on Campbell Scientific
* Enable datastream blocks in test automate script to mirror production usage
* Add tests for data and metadata stores, and remove similar code from station tests
* Add tests for data file parsing for Campbell Scientific
* Add tests for partial download support
* Extract partial download code to shared methods
* Add DataFile class for re-using data file partial downloading between providers
* Download data file metadata for Data Garrison when downloading metadata
* Use Data File partial downloads for Data Garrison instead of HTML parsing for observations

## Version 0.5.0 (2019-07-26)

The "HTTP and Ontology" Refactoring Release

* Create HTTP wrapper to abstract away `net/http` from all the other classes
* Add Vagrantfile for starting a VM with FROST for testing
* Improve compatibility with HTTPS connections
* Add a User-Agent for the crawler
* Replace command line interface with better option parser-based command line interface
* Add validation checks for command line options
* Support uploading observations for a time interval instead of a single timestamp
* RENAME command line options to be closer to their usage in the station classes
* Use `time` instead of `date`/`datetime` in Ruby
* Add RDF Ontology file for clearly mapping observed properties from data providers to a standard vocabulary that can be re-used in SensorThings API
* Import known properties from the providers into the Ontology. Some properties that have not been downloaded in testing may be missing.
* Add Ontology mappings for Units of Measurement
* Add Ontology mappings for observation types
* Move provider-specific classes to subdirectories to clean up parent directory
* Add allow/block feature for controlling what data/metadata is uploaded to SensorThings API

## Version 0.4.0 (2019-07-12)

The "RSpec" Refactoring Release

* Clean up how station classes are instantiated with `get_station` and `new_station`
* Refactor the provider class interface to use `get` and `new` terms
* Improve usage of Ruby named keyword parameters for methods
* Add some documentation for metadata mapping procedure
* Fix broken Environment Canada integration due to new station list format (their change)
* Fix URL used for Data Garrison metadata to prevent bug where metadata was missed
* Add support for PUT requests to SensorThings API (usage only needed for some STA implementations)
* Fix wrong URL being cached due to body/header mismatch coming back from STA (GOST)
* Switch from testing with GOST to SensorUp Scratchpad for better STA support
* Use RSpec and VCR for integration testing station download/upload
* Standardize on symbolized keys in station classes to prevent bug where JSON deserialization would create string keys instead
* Add `semantic_logger` gem for improved logging output
* Switch from SensorUp Scratchpad to local FROST server for easier resets of testing data
* Issue another GET request for entity's true selfLink as some STA implementations (FROST) do not include a created entity in the response body
* Replace calls to `exit` with `raise` to not cause mysterious RSpec failures
* Fix for `$filter` usage where dates should not be quoted (FROST)
* Improve reliability of Campbell Scientific download/upload
* Standardize date format used for specifying uploads
* Change Campbell Scientific classes to only upload latest observation like the other providers instead of uploading all observations

* Support HTTP partial downloads for Campbell Scientific CSV files
* Increase upload timeouts for long uploads to SensorThings API
* Support STA upload for Campbell Scientific
* Fix timezone storage in local cache files

## Version 0.2.0 (2019-02-28)

The "Data Garrison" Support Release

* Support download from Data Garrison data
* Add warnings for manual data correction requirement
* Support STA upload for Data Garrison

## Version 0.1.0 (2018-05-09)

The Initial "Environment Canada" Support Release

* Download Environment Canada weather data to cache files
* Create script to parse command line arguments
* Download Environment Canada station metadata to cache file
* Create sub-directories for data, metadata cache
* Create STA entities from metadata, upload to STA
* Re-use existing STA entities, if possible
* Build internal SensorThings API Ruby library
